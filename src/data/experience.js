        <p>
        The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) is a non-ministerial government agency that reports directly to the President and is tasked with conducting statistical activities in accordance with laws and regulations. The types of statistics managed include basic statistics that are fully implemented by BPS, sectoral statistics that are managed by government agencies themselves or in collaboration with BPS, and special statistics that are conducted independently by various parties or in collaboration with BPS.
        </p>
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-4">Problems</h1>
        <p>
        During my internship at the Buleleng Regency Central Statistics Agency, the agency faced problems in monitoring statistical activities and financial administration. To overcome this, my team and I developed two information systems: Monaku and Monalisa. In Monalisa, technical features are used by organic employees to manage all statistical activities grouped by period and consisting of two stages, namely updating and enumeration, and classified into Company and Household activities. Meanwhile, the administrative features in Monaku serve as a repository for complete financial administration files with progress percentages and file counts to facilitate monitoring. All activities are managed on an annual basis to facilitate storage and archiving.
        </p>
        
      `,
      `
        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-4">Monaku & Monalisa</h1>
        <p>
        I served as a backend developer and was responsible for developing features for three main functions (IPDS, Production, and Balance Sheet). I designed the MySQL database, built CRUD technical activities and administrative documents, and implemented a user role system (Admin, Organic, Inorganic) with secure access control. I also ensured system security through middleware and Laravel Breeze authentication. In development, I used Laravel 10, jQuery AJAX, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Git.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl mb-4">Problem Background</h1>
        <p>
        My team and I proposed an IoT-based innovation aimed at addressing the issue of Fusarium oxysporum fungus in vanilla plants. This innovation is expected to help farmers increase their crop yields so that the productivity of local commodities can contribute to restoring the village’s economy through vanilla agriculture.

        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl my-4">V-Growz: Our Proposed Innovation</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">
        We created an innovation called V-Growz, where V stands for vanilla and Growz represents growth and development. V-Growz consists of three main features:
        </p>
       <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>V-Hydro:</strong> Controls humidity levels for vanilla plants and displays real-time data through a smartphone app and IoT panel.</li>
        <li><strong>V-Flow:</strong> Automates irrigation so farmers can water plants remotely when soil conditions are dry.</li>
        <li><strong>V-Lume:</strong> Automates shading (paranet) and provides information on sunlight intensity.</li>
      </ul>
      `,
      `
      <p class="my-4">
      During the implementation stage, we faced various challenges such as the mountainous location, which caused unstable IoT connectivity, and limited electricity availability. These factors pushed us to optimize the IoT system to be more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
      Throughout the project, we built the IoT devices from scratch, including designing the IoT greenhouse structure, developing the IoT technology, setting up the MQTT server, creating UI/UX designs, and deploying the system into a mobile application ready for use by farmers in Ambengan Village.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
      The vanilla farmers in Ambengan expressed their gratitude to our team, acknowledging the positive impact our innovation brought to their vanilla farming practices.
